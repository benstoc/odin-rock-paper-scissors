//Get computer's choice
    //randomly generate a numer from 1-100
    //depending on outcome, assign 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors

// get user input
//Initialize a variable and set it's value to user input
//Initialize a bool variable for a loop
//loop until input is valid
//Check if the input is valid (rock, paper, or scissors)
    //If the input is valid exit loop
    //Re-prompt the user for input if input in invalid

//Compare user and computer inputs
//the win condition is as follows: rock > scissors > paper > rock
